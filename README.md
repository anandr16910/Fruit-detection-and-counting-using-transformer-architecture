# Fruit-detection-and-counting-using-transformer-architecture
A few-shot fruit counting app using the CounTR model, built for ARM devices. Combines RGB and synthetic NIR images (deepNIR dataset) for robust detection. Class-agnostic, no retraining needed—counts fruits by exemplar matching with attention mechanism. Ideal for edge-based agricultural monitoring and yield assessment.
